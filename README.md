This repository contains a Power BI project that analyzes key trends and insights in the healthcare sector. The analysis includes visualizations and metrics to assist stakeholders in making data-driven decisions.

## üöÄFeatures
- Interactive dashboards for healthcare insights
- Key metrics on patient demographics, hospital performance, and service quality
- Data visualizations showcasing trends and anomalies
- Exported reports for sharing with decision-makers

## üìàStep by Step Process
### Load Data:

- Navigate to the Transform Data tab.
- Connect to the dataset or update file paths for local data sources.
- Validate and refresh data.
### Data Cleaning:

- Remove duplicate or inconsistent records.
- Handle missing data by appropriate methods (e.g., imputation or removal).
### Data Analysis:

- Create calculated columns or measures using DAX (e.g., patient recovery rates).
- Filter and sort data to identify key trends.
### Dashboard Creation:

#### Design visualizations for:
#### Summary:
- **Total Waiting List Commparison:** Commparison between Latest Month Waiting List and Previous Latest Month Waiting List

- **Time band vs. Age Profile:** The chart uses a stacked bar format to display the average number of patients on the waitlist across different Time Bands (waiting durations) and segmented by 
  - Age Profiles:

      Time Bands (x-axis): 0‚Äì3 months, 3‚Äì6 months, etc., up to 18+ months.

      Age Profiles (color-coded): 0‚Äì15 years (Blue)16‚Äì64 years (Orange)65+ years (Purple)

      The y-axis represents the number of patients waiting (count).

- **Top 5 Specify cases:** Accident&Emergency, Paed Cardiology, Paed Orthopaedic, Paediatric Dermatology, Paediatric ENT

- **Monthly Trend Analysis: Day Case / Inpatient vs. Outpatients:**
  The visual is divided into two line charts, displaying trends for Day Case, Inpatient, and Outpatient categories over time.

  **Left Chart:** 
  Day Case and Inpatient 
  
  - **Blue Lines:** Upper Blue Line: Represents the Day Case trend.

       - Shows patient counts for scheduled day procedures.
       - Peaks around July 2020 (62K) and then declines slightly in subsequent months.
       -  Consistent baseline before and after the peak.
  -  Orange Line: Represents the Inpatient trend.

      - Represents patients admitted for overnight stays.
     - Displays smaller fluctuations, with consistent counts around 20K‚Äì25K.
     - Slight increase in July 2020, possibly due to seasonal factors or increased capacity.
  **Right Chart:** Outpatient
   - LowerBlue Line: Represents the Outpatient trend.
     - Displays significantly higher volumes (measured in millions).
     - Shows a steady upward trend from 0.50M (July 2018) to 0.62M (January 2021).
     -  Indicates growth in outpatient visits, which could reflect improvements in accessibility or follow-up care.

#### Detailview:
- **Filter Criteria:** The provided image shows a filter panel commonly used in healthcare data analysis dashboards. Here‚Äôs a detailed explanation:

  - **Purpose:**
    This filter allows users to refine and customize the data they want to view, often to identify patterns or analyze specific metrics in healthcare projects.

  - **Key Components:**
     - Archive_Data (Date Range): A date range slider and fields enable the user to filter records based on the data's archive period. The range here is from January 31, 2018, to February 27, 2021.

     - Case_Type: A dropdown for selecting specific types of healthcare cases (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, emergency) or viewing all case types.

    - Specialty_Name: Another dropdown to filter data based on medical specialties (e.g., cardiology, neurology) or include all specialties.

    - Age_Profile: Filters data by age groups. In this instance, the selected profile is 0-15 age categorie to  16‚Äì64 age categorie, likely representing working-age adults.

    - Time_Bands: This filter categorizes data by time intervals, such as the duration of cases or treatments. The selection here is 0-3 Months to 18+ Months, which might reflect cases lasting over 18 months.
